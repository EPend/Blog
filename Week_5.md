# Fifth Week

This week we didn't have a meeting as the university was closed so I worked on
the same thing as last week. 

I have updated the class diagram for the most up to date version of the cube.

I have also spent time looking at how we can structure our seperated classes into different packages that can interact with
a main application. Whilst I am doing this, I am also finding more about using interfaces to handle call backs for both javafx
and timer threads for ui display.
