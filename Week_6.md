# Fifth Week

A lot of progress has been made on my end this week, i've created several interfaces to handle callbacks between the 
engine and javafx classes, this includes a fully working timer.

Time spent: 4 hours

As of 14/03/2018 this is the current project structure I have.

I am also working on an algorithm to allow the user to enter in a word instead of using the cube, and it will either return false, or 
true with a linked list of cube ids to create the word on the cube.

Time spent: 1 hours

As of 15/03/2018 I found brute forcing it was a terrible idea and never should be tried by anyone. No more loops please.

Implemented 99% of call back interfaces, fixed thread issue Matthew raised earlier, combined more game logic and javafx components
together. I also fixed the timer so instead of starting straight away it starts when the game is started.

Time spent: 2 hours
