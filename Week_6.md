# Fifth Week

A lot of progress has been made on my end this week, i've created several interfaces to handle callbacks between the 
engine and javafx classes, this includes a fully working timer.

As of 14/03/2018 this is the current project structure I have.

I am also working on an algorithm to allow the user to enter in a word instead of using the cube, and it will either return false, or 
true with a linked list of cube ids to create the word on the cube.
