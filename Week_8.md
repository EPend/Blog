# Eighth Week

## Refactoring

I've starting work on refactoring the Main.java class into several smaller classes with a scene manager that can be used to swap between the scenes, it's not fully done yet since everything is tangled together in a mess of variables but it seems like a viable way to do things.

## Update 27/04

Refactoring and separating classes is done, everything should be a lot nicer to deal with now and easier to change in the future.

Time spent: 4 hours.

Updated class diagrams and Design documentation to reflect the current state of the build, refactored a lot of variables/functions,
improved some functionalities across all scenes.

Time spent: 2 hours.
