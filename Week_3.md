# Third Week

For this week I focused mostly on getting an implementation of our adjacency detection working with the updated cubes that Matt D. was creating.

My progress can be seen on gitlab where I have successfully added a working selection function with de-selection capabilities that allow you to undo turns infinitely.

Time spent: 2 hours

I also looked into the whole program architecture and came up with an idea to have a main application class that would create a user interface, cube representation and deal with the back end so none of the classes interact directly with each other and everything can be kept seperate throughout development.

Time spent: 1 hour
